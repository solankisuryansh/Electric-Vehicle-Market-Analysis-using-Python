# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Analysis-using-Python

This project is a comprehensive data analytics case study on electric vehicles, completed as part of my Data Analytics using Python coursework.

📁 Project Name: ev-data-analysis-python

🚀 Project Overview
This Python project analyzes a large real-world dataset of electric vehicles to uncover insights about EV trends, pricing, range, and environmental eligibility.

📌 Key Objectives:
Track EV adoption by year and make

Analyze electric range distribution

Compare MSRP across vehicle types (BEV vs. PHEV)

Visualize correlation between features

Examine CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility

🛠 Tools & Libraries:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Cleaning & EDA

Statistical summaries and visualization

📈 Outcome:
This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and storytelling with data. It also deepened my understanding of the growing EV landscape and how data science can contribute to a sustainable future.
